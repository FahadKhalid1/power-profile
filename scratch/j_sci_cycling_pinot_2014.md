# Determination of Maximal Aerobic Power on the field in cycling

**J. Pinot and F. Grappe,** *Journal of Science and Cycling, 2014*

## Method information

### Data analysis

The sampling time used is the following: `[0.016, 0.083, 0.5, 1, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5, 5.5, 6, 6.5, 7, 10, 20, 30, 45, 60, 120, 180, 240]`

### Maximum Aerobic Power (MAP) determination

* Log-linear fitting for the following sampling time: `[10, 20, 30, 45, 60, 120, 180, 240]`

### Aerobic Endurance Index (AEI) determination

* Data express in percentage of the MAP.
* Log-linear fitting for the following sampling time: `[tMAP, 240]` with the sampling used in WKO+.
